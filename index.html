            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>The first few thinks you should know about me are that i am 29 years old, i am married, and i am looking for a career change.</p>
            <h3><pre>Career Change</pre></h3>
            <p>I have been in the optical field for a 6 year now. The reason i am lookig for a career change now is because my wife and i are looking to start a family and to put it simply, the finances aren't there for us to be able to do that really. so that is why i am starting this web development class.<br/>Why did i choose web development? Well i knew that tech is the field to go into if you want to make money right now. I also like that while i can get a job with a big company web development will give me a skill that I can go and <q>freelance</q> when i need to make some money on the side. </p>
            <p><span>Financial stress is &lt; The stress ofgoing back to school & More money &gt; Less money!</span>  </p>
